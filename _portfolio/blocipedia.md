<b>Explanation</b>
Blocipedia will allow users to publicly and privately create wikis as part of a community. Users will have the ability to create/edit/delete wikis as well as to comment and designate favorite wikis. When a new comment is added to a user's favorite wiki, the user wil receive an email update.
