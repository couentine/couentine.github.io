I am Quentin, I moved to San Francisco in 2016 from France to join my fiancee after years of long distance. Formerly a seasoned hospitality manager with a degree in Business Management. I proactively started my professional life in the US by founding my own small international marketing company. Though we were profitable I have always been interested in computers and programming. Being in San Francisco has provided me with the opportunity to learn this skill set. I am currently enrolled in the Software Engineering program at Bloc. Looking to pave my way into a new career. I am an extremely humble and hard worker who is passionate about problem solving through innovate and efficient solutions. Looking for an entry level software engineering position at a company that can provide room for growth.
